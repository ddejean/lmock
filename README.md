General information about this source tree
==========================================
Thanks for downloading Lmock. This README file contains directives about how to play with those sources.

Overall organization
--------------------
The main directories of this project are:
* src/main: Lmock sources
* src/test: JUnit tests of Lmock
* doc: the project documentation

The examples sub-directory contains informal examples of JUnit tests that do not necessarily pass.
The tests are aimed to run on a basic java environment with JUnit4. For Android, you should use the converter provided by tool/send2Droid, as explained later in this document.

You may edit Lmock with your favorite IDE:
* Netbeans: please use the formatter provided in tools/nb-formatter.zip to align with the coding conventions of this project
* Other IDEs: there is no specific support (but it works well in Eclipse)
