Lmock - Mock test library with multi-thread support
===================================================

Lmock is a mock testing library designed to write tests as we tell a story. It
has been designed to support mock calls on multiple threads.

It relies on the following paradigm to design your tests: “a test tells
a story that must comply with a scenario defined as a series of expectations
using mocks”.

The library was written by David Furodet (@dfurodet) and published as an
open-source project by VMware, this repository is a fork dedicated to modernize
the build, maintain the library and publish an up to date artifact.

You can get familiar with the library concepts by refering to the documentation
available in the [Wiki](/xioxoz/lmock/wiki).
